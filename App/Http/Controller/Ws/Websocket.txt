ExpressWebjs makes use of Socket.IO which is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications.
It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts:
a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. 
Both components have a nearly identical API.
