# Expressweb.js

Expresswebjs is a Node FrameWork with expressive and organised syntax.It helps Node developers set up and structure their project in an object oriented way so as to enable code reuse. ExpressWebjs takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks (Environment Setup, Code Structure, Robust routing) used in many web projects. It supports both SQL and NOSQL databases.

## Requirements

Before installing, download and install Node.js. Node.js 0.10 or higher is required.

If this is a brand new project, make sure to create a package.json first with the npm init command.

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
  Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v8.11.3

    $ npm --version

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.
